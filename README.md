# PWA--Text-Editor

## Description

The motivation was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline.

I learnt about using IndexedDB database, idb, IndexedDB API and much more.
